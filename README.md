# ListProject

A web application that allows the user to make their own tailored todo list and track their completed activities for the day. The list allows user to categorize if the todo of the day is for Work or Home; and the list keeps score of the completed todos in comparison to the total numbers of the todos under their category. There are checkboxes that the user can use to mark their todo completed and once a task is checked it gets added to that todo tracker.
